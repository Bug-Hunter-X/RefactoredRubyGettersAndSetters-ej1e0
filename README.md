# Incorrect Getter and Setter Methods in Ruby

This repository demonstrates a simple, yet common error in Ruby related to getter and setter methods.  The example showcases how incorrect implementation can lead to unexpected behavior and potential bugs.

The `bug.rb` file contains the code exhibiting the error. The `bugSolution.rb` file provides the corrected code.

This is a basic illustration, but the principle applies to more complex scenarios where improper handling of instance variables can cause subtle and hard-to-debug issues.
